The first movement of the spatial audio 360 VR piece __From Within,
From Without__ by Enda Bates is now on
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/WQvHH-u9W5w). Enda has published a very
detailed
[post](https://endabates.wordpress.com/2016/05/27/spatial-audio-360-video/)
about the project and immersive spatial audio. The music was performed
by Pedro López López, Trinity Orchestra, and Cue Saxophone Quartet in
Trinity College Dublin on April 8th, 2016 (see previous my previous
[post]({% post_url 2016-04-19-trinity360 %}) and [Enda's
blog](https://endabates.wordpress.com)).

At the moment the best way to watch it is with Google's Cardboard VR
headset and an Android phone as only YouTube's Android app supports
spatial audio.

This is the first piece in a series of immersive spatial audio
experiences that we plan to record in Trinity College Dublin.

At the moment we've simply stitched the 12 GoPros from our 360 rig
using off the shelf software (VideoStitch 2). There are still some
visible artefacts that are mainly due to parallax. We'll get our own
video processing algorithms working at some point and try to improve
on this.
