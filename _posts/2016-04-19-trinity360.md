Trinity College Dublin composer and teaching fellow in the [Music and Media Technology Programme](https://www.tcd.ie/eleceng/mmt/), [Enda Bates](http://www.endabates.net/), composed a multi-movement spatial music work, entitled __From Within, From Without__. The piece was performed in Trinity’s Exam Hall on the 8th of April as part of Trinity’s Creative Challenge Showcase.

The concert comprised of an acoustic, electroacoustic, and electronic spatial music and was filmed using 360˚ cameras and microphones for Virtual Reality (VR) presentation. We are currently working on the video side of the VR capture. On this occasion, we've designed a compact home brew 12 GoPro's stereo 360 Rig (timelapse below).
