My paper on an alternative Matting Laplacian has been recently accepted at [ICIP 2016](2016.ieeeicip.org). I have uploaded the preprint to [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04785) and the reference code is also available on my [github repository](https://github.com/frcs/alternative-matting-laplacian):
