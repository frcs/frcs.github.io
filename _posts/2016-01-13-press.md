Today was the opening day for the ADAPT SFI centre. I was demonstrating for [Sigmedia](www.sigmedia.tv) some of our 3D technology for creative artists. There was a bit of news coverage on [RTÉ news](https://www.rte.ie/news/player/2016/0113/20911321-50m-to-be-invested-on-national-research-centre-for-on-digital-content/).
